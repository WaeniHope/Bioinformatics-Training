# Bioinformatics-Training
## About me
I am a student in [Moi University Eldoret](https://www.mu.ac.ke/) pursing **_B.Sc Microbiology_**. 
Curiosity and the need to know brought me to the Scientific world especially Biological aspect of everything.
Ansering questions like why micro and macro organisms do what they do, how our bodies behave a certain way and how diseases come to be etc. makes it worthwhile.
Apart from Science,I love animals both domestic and wild ones. If I could I would become a veterinary officer(_back to Science again_ðŸ˜¸ ) but that is on a light note. 
I love particpating and watching sports. Its always the thrill for me.
## Introduction
Science is food to basic and complex curiosity. I love it gives explanations and posibilities of solutions to health problems. 
I myself would like to make an impact in the world research and maybe solve some problems ailing the world today whether as minor scientist or like major scientists such as; 
+ **[Rosalind Franklin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosalind_Franklin)**-Her discovery on DNA and its structure.
+ **[Frederick Griffith](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/griffiths-experiment)**- Pathology of bacterial pneumonia.
+ **[Robert Hooke](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/history-cell-discovering-cell/)**-Discovery of the cell and microscope advancements
  
  ( I know big dreamer there ðŸ¤“)
## Purpose
Curently venturing into Bioinformatics field to equip myself with extra information that links Science and IT basically.
Apart from **Bioinformatics** being and sounding very cool, it is very essential to Scientists as it helps in understanding projects and research.
Do I find it promising _yes_.Am I challenged and scared of it *also yes* ðŸ™‚But will I learn it _absolutely yes_ ðŸ‘Œ.
Looking forward to the day I'll have all the basics I need to understand most if not all the coding and computer languages that I will find along the way.
Let'S hope right on!
